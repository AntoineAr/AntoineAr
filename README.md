### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After obtaining a master's degree in economics, I worked as an analysis and monitoring officer in a company producing data and offering strategic and commercial monitoring solutions in the real estate sector. I am currently undergoing training in data science, after learning to process and analyze data, I am gradually learning to use machine learning tools to solve various issues.
The challenges surrounding AI interest me, and I am already fascinated by the power of certain algorithms.
